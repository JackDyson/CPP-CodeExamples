# CPP-CodeExamples

This is my current university project.
It is an unfinished text based game that uses C++
Most things in the game are randomised

The player can:
  heal in an empty room if health < 100,
  attack or defend against enemies with 50% chance of success
  and open chests to obtain new items either defence buff or strength buff
  
The aim of this game is to get to the artifact at the end of the dungeon.
There are a ramdom amount of rooms the player must go through in order to get to the goal. 
It is a managable amount that will allow the player to experience every room I have coded.
